## About CPSSD

[Computational Problem Solving and Software Development](https://www4.dcu.ie/courses/undergraduate/computing/computational-problem-solving-and-software-development.shtml/) (CPSSD) is an undergraduate computing course in [Dublin City University](http://dcu.ie) that requires applicants to have a prior knowledge of programming. This means that students can save time re-learning the basics, and jump straight into making some cool things.

The course has a special admission procedure. Applicants do not need to worry about points, but must submit a portfolio, pass an interview, achieve the minimum DCU entry requirements, and pass honours maths. This is outlined in detail [here](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/undergraduate/pssd/portfolio-interview).

## About This Site
The [official CPSSD site](http://www.computing.dcu.ie/undergraduate/pssd/computational-problem-solving-software-development-cpssd) should be the primary reference for anyone interested in the course. However, those pages are very dense and formal, with many typos, and no way for us to edit them.

This site exists to give a friendlier introduction to CPSSD, from the viewpoint of the students. It is in no way official or endorsed by DCU. It would be nice if it was, though.
