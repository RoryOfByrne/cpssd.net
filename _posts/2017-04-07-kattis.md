title: "CPSSDs on Kattis"

[Kattis](https://open.kattis.com) is an online judge for competitive programming problems, that some CPSSD students have been using to practise for various competitions. You can read about our success at one [here](https://cpssd.net/hashcode), for example.

Because of the hard work of several DCU students, including CPSSDs, Dublin City University has become the [number one university in Ireland](https://open.kattis.com/countries/IRL) on the site, and just today became the [50th placed university in the world](https://open.kattis.com/ranklist/universities).

In fact, DCU is the only Irish university in the top 100, and is the 21st placed in Europe. Out of our neighbouring countries, only the universities of Edinburgh and Oxford are ranked better.

Ireland as a whole has also risen up [the rankings](https://open.kattis.com/ranklist/countries) recently, and is currently the 27th placed country in the world, just behind France. It may soon pass out France too - vive la révolution!

I decided to do some research to measure how much impact CPSSD students had in raising the reputation of Ireland and of DCU on Kattis. The website is kind enough to [explain its ranking algorithm in detail](https://open.kattis.com/help/ranklist). In short, here is what it does to measure a group's combined score:

- It takes the individual scores of everyone in the group, and sorts them.
- A formula is given to provide the weighting that each member of the group's score should have in finding the final combined score. The higher you are in the group, the more your score impacts the combined score.
- For example, the first placed person in the group adds 20% of their score to the combined amount, while the second placed person adds 16% of their score.
- It adds together each individual score multiplied by its above weighting to get a final answer.

I wrote a script [that you can see here](https://gist.github.com/iandioch/ac633cf2e130b050ee1f6a7a565b6da2) to measure how much of this number is provided by CPSSD students. Here are the results:

```
Rank	Score	% Added	# Added	Cumulative Tot		Name
#1	433.8	20.0%	86.76	( 86.76)		Noah Ó Donnaile
#2	307.6	16.0%	49.22	(135.98)		Cian Ruane
#3	290.4	12.8%	37.17	(173.15)		Stefan Kennedy
#7	145.9	 5.2%	 7.65	(180.80)		Brandon Ibbotson
#29	 13.0	 0.0%	 0.01	(180.80)		Ross O'Sullivan
#30	  9.6	 0.0%	 0.00	(180.80)		Cliodhna Harrison
#31	  7.2	 0.0%	 0.00	(180.81)		Ciaran Murphy
#35	  5.8	 0.0%	 0.00	(180.81)		Lucas Savva
#39	  3.8	 0.0%	 0.00	(180.81)		Oskar McDermott
CPSSD Total: 180.81
Ireland Total: 250.80
CPSSD Percent: 72.0921
```

You can see here that CPSSD students provide a total of 72% of Ireland's score! Without this contribution, Ireland would have a score of a little under 70, leaving it in 62nd place in the global rankings, a hair behind Venezuela.

It is clear that CPSSD has managed to gather some talented students, as I believe was its aim. However, while individually many of us are undoubtedly talented, what has struck me is that the competition and collaberation available when we are together is the real catalyst. This could be summed up in the saying "the whole is greater than the sum of its parts", but I think the following is more exciting:

Let's hope DCU and CPSSD keep climbing up the ranks!

Ádh mór leat,
